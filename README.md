# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Database Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling when interacting with a database.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that creates a new user.  It makes a database call but lacks proper error handling. If the database operation fails (due to a network issue, invalid data, etc.), the application will either crash or return a generic error message, making debugging difficult.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the improved code. It includes comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks and provides more informative error messages to the client.
